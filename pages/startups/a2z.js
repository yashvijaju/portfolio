A2Z started as a pay-per-copy magazine that quickly converted into an advertisement-driven bi-monthly magazine distributed to 400+ flats in my housing society free of cost. <br/>As the founder, I learned to handle finances, seek advertisers, and negotiate costs. <br/>As the editor, I learned to edit articles and images, to create a narrative that strung all the different pieces of the magazine together into a single cohesive structure. <br/>As the co-founder, I learned to understand user markets, adapt models to cater to the target audience, and to choose suppliers at the intersection of price and quality. <br/>As an extremely young entrepreneur, I learned to chase my dreams to fruition and to ride the wave. But, more importantly, I learned failure and understood to withdraw when the tide gets too high.</div>}/>
